## ICU_Queries
This project aims to identify patients from the eICU Collaborative Research Database who have been treated with neuromuscular blockers (NMBs) and also diagnosed with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). The goal is to facilitate research into treatment patterns, outcomes, and potential insights into the management of ARDS patients receiving NMBs.
